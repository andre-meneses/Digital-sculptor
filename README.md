# Digital Sculptor

## Introduction
This project was developed as part of an advanced programming class, the goal was to build a program that allows the user to draw three dimensional figures from basic forms such as spheres, boxes and elipses. 

## Implementation  

### Voxel
The figures are drawn from 3d pixels called voxels. Each drawing constitutes a matrix of voxels that are arranged according to the user instructions. A voxel can be posisioned individually through an (x,y,z) coordinate, or a more complex form that draws several voxels can be choosen. Voxels can also be erased in order to create negative spaces.

Once the drawing is finished, an OFF file is created. One can visualize the 3d drawing by using a program such as MeshLab or geomview.
